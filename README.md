# ✈️ Airline Flight Performance Dashboard – Power BI Project  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project is an **interactive Power BI Dashboard** built using a dataset of over **1 million airline flight records (2015)**. It analyzes key airline performance metrics — such as **flight delays, cancellation reasons, average delay times, total delay cost, and on-time performance** — to deliver actionable insights.  

The goal is to help **airlines, airports, and decision-makers** improve their **operational efficiency, reduce delays, optimize costs**, and enhance **on-time performance** through data-driven insights.

# 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  

The dashboards highlight essential KPIs to evaluate airline performance and operational impact:

- ✈️ **Total Flights:** 6M+  
- 🕐 **On-Time Flights:** 5M+  
- ⏱️ **Average Arrival Delay:** 4.40 mins  
- 💸 **Total Delay Cost:** $3.13 billion  
- 📉 **On-Time Percentage:** 82%  
- ⚠️ **Airline Delay Percentage:** 32%  

---

# 📌 Key Insights & Findings  

- ✈️ Approximately **82%** of flights arrived **on-time**, with **5 million on-time flights** out of 6 million.  
- 🌦️ The most common delay causes include **Air System issues** and **Late Aircraft**, contributing to over **60%** of total delays.  
- 📊 **AA Airlines** managed the **highest number of flights**, but had a **higher cost per flight**, indicating potential operational inefficiencies.  
- 🏙️ A small number of major airports are responsible for over **70% of cancellations and delays**, making them key focus areas for improvement.  
- 💼 Flight delays resulted in an estimated **$3.13 billion cost**, significantly impacting overall profitability.  
- 📈 Benchmarking reveals opportunities to improve on-time performance and reduce costs by optimizing flight operations and addressing root causes.

---

# ✅ Final Recommendations  

- **Optimize key delay causes** (e.g., Air System, Late Aircraft) through predictive maintenance and improved scheduling.  
- **Focus on top delay airports** to implement targeted solutions and enhance network reliability.  
- **Improve cost efficiency** by reducing per-flight operational expenses and improving turnaround times.  
- **Leverage predictive analytics** to anticipate seasonal delays and proactively adjust operations.  
- **Continuously benchmark airline performance** to maintain a competitive edge and align with industry standards.
